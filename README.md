# **Welcome to my profile**

## **Motto**
Deliver highly scalable and efficient test automation solutions within a reasonable budget and timeline. I aspire to take the next step as a strategic leader by integrating Machine Learning into testing practices and establishing Cognitive QA capabilities within test frameworks. Areas of interest include Machine Learning, Robotics, Cloud Cybersecurity, and AI.

---

## **Significant Accomplishments**
- Designed and implemented a functional testing framework for cybersecurity products using Python Robot.
- Developed an API testing framework utilizing Vitest, PactumJS, and JavaScript.
-  Built network problem detection test automation that runs multiple times daily across environments.
-  Designed a framework simulating network anomalies using Protobuf/Avro messages (gRPC & gNMI) and injecting them into Kafka/Kinesis streams.
-  Created a non-functional test suite for microservices using the open-source Gatling framework, parameterizing input combinations such as simulations, user load, and traffic rate per second via Jenkins.
-  Developed an IoT integration defects dashboard using Python, Cloud JSON, and JavaScript, providing insights for 24-hour, 7-day, and 30-day runs.
-  Constructed a test metrics dashboard for the QA organization using AWS S3, RDS, and QuickSight to offer intuitive insights to senior management and various teams.
